Turn android devices into a touch keyboard for peaple with Rheumatoid arthritis.

# My story
Diagnosis with Rheumatoid arthritis in a young age (24 in my case) is like reaching the end of the world. But I don't want to give up. I'm a young noviceprogrammer/PCB-Designer who works almost 10 hours a day with computer. Standard keyboard only make the pain worse. So I developed this little project to create touch-based keyboard that works over wifi.
